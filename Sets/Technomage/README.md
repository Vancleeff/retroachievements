# Achievement Set - Technomage - PSX (2001)
## Game info
**Name :** TechnoMage Return of Eternity\
**Platform :** PSX\
**Genre :** RPG\
**Developer :** Sunflowers\
**Publisher :** Sunflowers\
**Release date :** 06-29-2001

## Set presentation
The game follows a very linear path with no side-quest, every single quest that are present in the game is part of the main story and mandatory for progression.\3
Therefore, I've decided to create achievements only for quests where the reward is a unique item such as new weapons, spells or tools.\
As Technomage is a chill and easy little RPG, the set doesn't contains hardcore achievements. Some may represent a challenge but nothing too daunting. The entire set can be completed in a single playthrough but players need to pay attention to many missable cheevos.\
I hope you enjoy the game !
