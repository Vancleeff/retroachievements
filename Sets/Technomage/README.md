# Achievement Set - Technomage - PSX (2001)
## Game info
**Name :** TechnoMage Return of Eternity\
**Platform :** PSX\
**Genre :** RPG\
**Developer :** Sunflowers\
**Publisher :** Sunflowers\
**Release date :** 06-29-2001

## Set presentation
The game follows a very linear path with no side-quest, every single quest that are present in the game is part of the main story and mandatory for progression.\3
Therefore, I've decided to create achievements only for quests where the reward is a unique item such as new weapons, spells or tools.\
As Technomage is a chill and easy little RPG, the set doesn't contains hardcore achievements. Some may represent a challenge but nothing too daunting. The entire set can be completed in a single playthrough but players need to pay attention to many missable cheevos.\
I hope you enjoy the game !

# GAME GUIDE
This guide is just about the set and present a way to get all the achievement in one playthrough.\

| Legend                | Reach level 20                                       |

### Tips for "Merchant" achievement
To reach 4000 golds, you will have to sell a lot of potions which will make your playthrough harder to finish (but still feasible).
There's not a lot of shop in the game so be sure to take every opportunity to sell some of your stuff. Here's the list of shops : 
* SteamerTown - Lars' Shop
* Jelon - Miriven at the Inn
* Canyon - Torlore at the Shach Camp
* ShachTown - Yayzn at the Market place\
\

Selling 1/3 of your stuff should be enough to reach the 4000 golds in chapter 8.\
Be sure to always kill every enemies and destroy every crates to collect a lot of money and of course, try to not take too much damage to have more potions to sell.

### Tips for "Mystic Energy Drain/Mystic Charged Attack " achievements
To reach lvl 28 in Mysticism, you'll have to attribute 8 points to the skill or 7 if you found and used a cube.

### Tips for "Master" achievement
To reach lvl 40 in one skill, you'll have to focus on one of your skill and attribute it at least one point every level. You can eventually skip one point if you found and used a cube.
I highly suggest you to maximize your Strength to get more damage during your playthrough.

### Tips for "Legend" achievement
While it's almost impossible to miss the lvl 15 achievement, reaching lvl 40 can be missed if you skipped too much enemies during your playthrough.
Try to kill everything, everywhere, this way you will also get all the "Discover 100% of Map X" achievements and earn a lot of money for "Gold related" cheevos.

#### Mouse Trap
During the fight with the Giant Rat, in Uncle Rissen's basement, kill the Boss without taking any damage.\
It's not that hard if you get the good timing. Try to approach him and he will attack you, avoid it by moving backward and immediately go back to him to hit once and move back again. Don't try to hit twice or there's high chance that the rats will touch you on his second attack, he's fast. Repeat the strategy a dozen of time and you're good.
