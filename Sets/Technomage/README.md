# Achievement Set - Technomage - PSX (2001)
## Game info
**Name :** TechnoMage Return of Eternity\
**Platform :** PSX\
**Genre :** RPG\
**Developer :** Sunflowers\
**Publisher :** Sunflowers\
**Release date :** 06-29-2001

## Set presentation
The game follows a very linear path with no side-quest, every single quest that are present in the game is part of the main story and mandatory for progression.\
Therefore, I've decided to create achievements only for quests where the reward is a unique item such as new weapons, spells or tools.\
As Technomage is a chill and easy little RPG, the set doesn't contains hardcore achievements. Some may represent a challenge but nothing too daunting. The entire set can be completed in a single playthrough but players need to pay attention to many missable cheevos.\
I hope you enjoy the game !

# GAME GUIDE
This guide is just about the set and present a way to get all the achievement in one playthrough.\

| Legend                | Reach level 20                                       |

### Tips for "Merchant" achievement
To reach 4000 golds, you will have to sell a lot of potions which will make your playthrough harder to finish (but still feasible).
There's not a lot of shop in the game so be sure to take every opportunity to sell some of your stuff. Here's the list of shops : 
* SteamerTown - Lars' Shop
* Jelon - Miriven at the Inn
* Canyon - Torlore at the Shach Camp
* ShachTown - Yayzn at the Market place\
\

Selling 1/3 of your stuff should be enough to reach the 4000 golds in chapter 8.\
Be sure to always kill every enemies and destroy every crates to collect a lot of money and of course, try to not take too much damage to have more potions to sell.

### Tips for "Mystic Energy Drain/Mystic Charged Attack " achievements
To reach lvl 28 in Mysticism, you'll have to attribute 8 points to the skill or 7 if you found and used a cube.

### Tips for "Master" achievement
To reach lvl 40 in one skill, you'll have to focus on one of your skill and attribute it at least one point every level. You can eventually skip one point if you found and used a cube.
I highly suggest you to maximize your Strength to get more damage during your playthrough.

### Tips for "Legend" achievement
While it's almost impossible to miss the lvl 15 achievement, reaching lvl 40 can be missed if you skipped too much enemies during your playthrough.
Try to kill everything, everywhere, this way you will also get all the "Discover 100% of Map X" achievements and earn a lot of money for "Gold related" cheevos.

Don't try to hit twice or there's high chance that the rats will touch you on his second attack, he's fast. Repeat the strategy a dozen of time and you're good.

#### Cube of Strength
Go to the store of SteamerTown and buy the cube from Lars, it will cost you 200 golds so be sure to not buying other stuff first. Don't use it if you want to unlock the "4d6" achievement.

#### Gravedigger
Inspect every tombs at the cemetary of SteamerTown

#### Resourceful
To get this done, you can't buy the Cork from Lars, at the store. You will need to find 6 Corks around the city. They are in containers, just inspect everething and destroy every crates and you should be good. Their position are random so I can't give you their exact position.

#### Machinist
You will have to kill the Scrapyard Monster without taking any damage. I highly suggest you to keep the mana potions found during this chapter for this fight. Be very careful at the beginning of the fight and use sideways to reach the boss cause the main access seems to trigger some weird damage from unknown source at the beginning of the fight. After that, it's

#### Plumber

#### Cube of Intelligence
During the Fight with the Giant Spider, turn around the walls the North West corner and you'll find the Cube. Don't use it if you want to unlock the "4d6" achievement.
If you missed it, you will have a second opportunity to have that cube at Yayzn's shop in ShachTown, during chapter 7 but it will cost 200 golds.

#### Arachnophobia
You will have to kill the Giant Spider without taking any damage. I highly suggest you to keep the mana potions found during this chapter for this fight. Here's a pattern to speed up the first half of the fight : You have to hide yourself behind the walls at each corner of the room, the Giant Spider will position herself in front of one of the side of the corner, waiting for her prey. Just leave by the other side and kick her ass and move back to your position.
 - Do this 2 times
 - The third time, cast a fireball cause if you hit her with a melee weapon, she will hit you with a nasty jump
 - The fourth time, she will trick you and will move directly after you leave your hideout, operation abort, step back.
 - Repeat this process until 50% of her HP bar
 - After that, she will start to jump and invoke baby spiders from time to time. The pattern will be way more chaotic so I suggest you to only use spells until the end of the fight. Be super careful with all the baby spiders and take your time to kill'em all to avoid taking damage from them.
 You can also playing it like a maggot and only use spells, but it will takes a lot of time and you will probably run out of mana potion and will have to wait for the natural regeneration to cast your spell. (again, be careful with baby spiders)
