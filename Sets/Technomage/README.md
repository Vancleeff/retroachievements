# Achievement Set - Technomage - PSX (2001)
## Game info
**Name :** TechnoMage Return of Eternity\
**Platform :** PSX\
**Genre :** RPG\
**Developer :** Sunflowers\
**Publisher :** Sunflowers\
**Release date :** 06-29-2001

## Set presentation
The game follows a very linear path with no side quests; every single quest present in the game is part of the main story and mandatory for progression.\
Therefore, I've decided to create achievements only for quests where the reward is a unique item such as new weapons, spells, or tools. \
As Technomage is a chill and easy little RPG, the set doesn't contain hardcore achievements. Some may represent a challenge, but nothing too daunting. The entire set can be completed in a single playthrough, but players need to pay attention to many missable cheevos. \
I hope you enjoy the game!

# GAME GUIDE
This guide is just about the set and presents a way to get all the achievements in one playthrough.\

## Achievements that can be done anytime (**missable**)

| Achievements          | Description                                          |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|

| Rockefeller           | Have 1000 golds in your pockets                      |
| Merchant              | Have 4000 golds in your pockets                      |
| Mystic Charged Attack | Reach lvl 21 in Mysticism and unlock the third perk  |

| Master                | Max out one of your skill                            |
| Legend                | Reach level 20                                       |

### Tips for "Merchant" achievement
To reach 4000 gold, you will have to sell a lot of potions, which will make your playthrough harder to finish (but still feasible). 
There are not many shops in the game, so be sure to take every opportunity to sell some of your stuff. Here's the list of shops:
* SteamerTown - Lars' Shop
* Jelon - Lonicera's Shop
* Canyon - Torlore at the Shach Camp
* ShachTown - Yayzn at the Marketplace\
\

Selling 1/3 of your stuff should be enough to reach 4000 gold in chapter 8.\ 
Be sure to always kill every enemy and destroy every crate to collect a lot of money and, of course, try to take as few damage as possible to keep more potions for selling.

### Tips for "Mystic Energy Drain/Mystic Charged Attack " achievement
To reach level 28 in Mysticism, you'll have to attribute 8 points to the skill or 7 if you found and used a cube.

### Tips for "Master" achievement
To reach level 40 in one skill, you'll have to focus on one of your skills and attribute it at least one point every level. You can eventually skip one point if you found and used a cube. I highly suggest you maximize your Strength/Intelligence to get more damage during your playthrough.

### Tips for "Legend" achievement
While it's almost impossible to miss the level 15 achievement, reaching level 20 can be missed if you skip too many enemies during your playthrough. 
Try to kill everything, everywhere; this way you will also get all the "Discover 100% of Map X" achievements and earn a lot of money for "Gold related" cheevos.

### Tips for Boss achievements
Before every Boss fight, the game will ask you to save the game, be sure to keep a save somewhere for those fights so you will have time later to focus on it and practice instead of spending too much time immediately. Some of them are quite challenging and will require some die and retry to understand the pattern of each Boss.

| Grown up, Melvin           | Jump on your mom's table                  |
| Thirst for Knowledge       | Read all the 7 books at the Library       |
| A Fresh Start for Glacnore | Give Glacnore 5 gold for information      |
| Mouse Trap                 | Kill the giant rat without taking damage  |

#### Grown up, Melvin
After the introduction, leave your room and jump on the table to piss off your mom.
Congratulation, you are now a true badass.

#### Thirst for Knowledge
Go to the Library of DreamerTown, bring back the books to the librarian to gain access to the bookshelves and read every one of them.

#### A Fresh Start for Glacnore
Go to the Inn and talk to Glacnore; he will ask you for 5 gold to give you information. Accept it.

#### Mouse Trap
During the fight with the Giant Rat in Uncle Rissen's basement, kill the boss without taking any damage.\
It's not that hard if you get the timing right. Try to approach him, and he will attack you; avoid it by moving backward and immediately go back to him to hit once and move back again. Don't try to hit twice or there's a high chance that the Boss will touch you on his second attack; he's fast. Repeat the strategy a dozen times, and you're good.

### Missable Achievements

| Achievements      | Description                                                              |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cube of Strength  | Get a magic cube of strength                                             |
| Resourceful       | Seal the burst steam pipes without buying a cork from Lars               |
| Gravedigger       | Inspect every tomb at the cemetery of SteamerTown                       |
| Plumber           | Resolve the water tank puzzle in SteamerTown in as few turns as possible |
| Machinist         | Kill the Scrapyard Monster without taking damage                         |

#### Cube of Strength
Go to the store in SteamerTown and buy the cube from Lars; it will cost you 200 gold, so be sure not to buy other stuff first. If you don't have enough money, smash some crates and search every houses. Don't use the cube right now if you want to unlock the "4d6" achievement.

#### Gravedigger
Inspect every tomb at the cemetery of SteamerTown

#### Resourceful
To get this done, you can't buy the cork from Lars at the store. You will need to find 6 corks around the city. They are in containers; just inspect everything and destroy every crate, and you should be good. Their positions are random, so I can't give you their exact positions.

#### Machinist
You will have to kill the Scrapyard Monster without taking any damage. I highly suggest you keep the mana potions found during this chapter for this fight. Be very careful at the beginning of the fight and use sideways to reach the boss because the main access seems to trigger some weird damage from an unknown source at the beginning of the fight. Just watch and learn the pattern, he's not very hard to predict.

#### Plumber
At the end of the chapter, during the Water Tanks riddle, you will have to solve it in 4 moves. When you are facing the Tanks gauges, use the left one 3 times, then the front one once, and you should get the achievement.

#### Cube of Intelligence
During the Fight with the Giant Spider, turn around the walls to the Northwest corner, and you'll find the Cube. Don't use it if you want to unlock the "4d6" achievement. 

#### Arachnophobia
You will have to kill the Giant Spider without taking any damage. I highly suggest you keep the mana potions found during this chapter for this fight. Here's a pattern to speed up the first half of the fight: You have to hide yourself behind the walls at each corner of the room; the Giant Spider will position herself in front of one of the sides of the corner, waiting for her prey. Just leave by the other side, kick her ass and move back to your position. 
- Do this 2 times; 
- the third time, cast a fireball because if you hit her with a melee weapon, she will hit you with a nasty jump. 
- The fourth time, she will trick you and will move directly after you leave your hideout; operation abort, step back. 
- Repeat this process until 50% of her HP bar. 
- After that, she will start to jump and invoke baby spiders from time to time. The pattern will be way more chaotic, so I suggest you only use spells until the end of the fight. Be super careful with all the baby spiders and take your time to kill them all to avoid taking damage from them. You can also play it like a maggot and only use spells, but it will take a lot of time, and you will probably run out of mana potions and will have to wait for natural regeneration to cast your spell. (Again, be careful with baby spiders)

#### Samuel De Champlain

#### Toadally Destroyed
You will have to kill the Giant Toad without taking any damage from him or from his critters. The most important thing to do during the fight is to take care of these critters as the boss will continue to throw more of them at you during the fight; they are fast and unpredictable, so you better have to kill them as soon as possible to avoid being submerged. Prefer ranged attack with your spells to kill the minions. Try to always hide yourself under the trees when the boss is in the air; this way, he will not be able to land on your head. Once he's on the ground, he will make one of these attacks: 
- The boss will turn back and throw Critters at you. Move immediately and kill them asap 
- The boss will attack you from range with his tongue. Dodge it and hit the boss 2-3 times 
- The boss will Blow at you to try to push you in the water. Dodge it and hit the boss 2-3 times. 
You will notice that there's a beehive in the tree. If you hit it, the boss will come to eat those bees, letting you some time to hit the boss 7-8 times. You can do it 3 times before the hive is destroyed. You can easily remove 40% of his life this way, without any risk of being hit; I suggest you use it halfway through the fight. You will probably have to practice a little to learn the pattern, but it's far from impossible.

#### Robin Hood
Be sure to keep a fair amount of Arrows before the fight. You can buy some at Shachtown. During the fight, you can go to the upper left corner, kill the fireball machine, and you will be out of range for most of the Boss' attacks. Simply use your bow to kill the boss, but beware of the bouncing fireballs that can still hit you from that spot.

#### Gladiator
Finish the arena of weapons without taking any damage. Just hit and run and be careful between fights to be at the center of the arena to avoid their first attack.

#### I Can Do It Half Naked
Finish the arena of Defence without changing your equipment or taking any potion. Take your time.

#### GoLame
You will have to kill the Golem without taking any damage. Before starting the fight, equip a bow, the Frost Bolt, the Magic Amulet, and the Speed Boots. After the beginning of the fight, a flying mob will pop, use your Frost Bolt to freeze him, giving you some time to position yourself in a safer place. Wait for the boss to stop his attack and activate your speed boots and run towards the left of the room. The mobs will lose your tracking and you will be out of range for the boss. Switch to the Lightning spell and alternate between spells and arrows to kill the Golem with ranged attacks.

#### Tough Nut
Prepare yourself for a hard fight. To maximize the benefits of your 3 potions, be sure to have 3 Large Combined Potions in your inventory. I suggest equipping Merlin's cape because a lot of damage will come from enemies' spells. During the first phase of the fight, try to stay at the beginning of the room; you will have fewer adds to deal with. Use your most powerful spell when you have enough mana to quickly drop the HP of the boss and make him move to the next platform. When it's done, go put the crystal at the center of the room and pass the bridge; you can try to stay on the bridge as long as possible if you can hit the boss with arrows and spells, this way you will be able to make some back and forth to avoid adds and damage and even get some natural regeneration. Continue to do that until the last platform (don't forget to make pauses between each phase to naturally regen your HP). After placing all the crystals, you will have to continue to hit the boss several times to finish the fight; this part seems a little random so if you are totally unlucky, it can take a moment to trigger the end of the fight, be patient... or lucky. Congratulations, you've mastered the game!
